# AzurLaneSource
Decompiled Lua files of the game Azur Lane.

* EN is up to date (v3.1.54 from 2019/11/25).
* CN is up to date (v3.1.56 from 2019/11/21).
* JP is up to date (v3.1.42 from 2019/11/21).
* KR decompilation is dropped after version 1.5.146 due to no more interest in the files (and it takes ages to download the files from their shitty server).
* TW decompilation just does not exist.

## Used tools
* LuaJIT Raw-Bytecode Decompiler (LJD)
* AssetStudio
