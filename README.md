# AzurLaneSource
Decompiled Lua files of the game Azur Lane.

* EN, CN are up to date.
* JP decompilation is dropped after version 3.0.170 due to a change of encryption in 3.1.29 (2019.11.14 update).
* KR decompilation is dropped after version 1.5.146 due to no more interest in the files (and it takes ages to download the files from their shitty server).
* TW decompilation just does not exist.

## Used tools
* LuaJIT Raw-Bytecode Decompiler (LJD)
* AssetStudio
